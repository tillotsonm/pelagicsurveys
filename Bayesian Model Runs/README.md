# Bayesian catch analysis

This directory contains files for a Bayesian analysis of FMWT catch data for several species: 
1. Longfin Smelt (age-0 and age-1); (2) Striped Bass (age-0); (3) American Shad (age-0 and age-1); (4) Northern Anchovy (age-0), and; (5) Threadfin Shad (age-0).

The analysis generally follows the methods developed in chapter 6 of the LTRM report, i.e. a Bayesian GLMM is used to perform something of a retrospective analysis to compare estimates of CPUV under scenarios with varying levels of sampling effort (e.g. dropping a certain percentage of tows in each survey region).
