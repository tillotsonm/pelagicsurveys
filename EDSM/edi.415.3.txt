      The Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring Program (EDSM) was initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016. EDSM focuses on providing real-time data to help managers respond to population patterns of Delta Smelt within the upper San Francisco Estuary, primarily by providing estimates of Delta Smelt distribution and abundance. The dataset can also be useful in evaluating habitat use and behavior patterns of this species and other fish species of interest. Sampling is done year round via Kodiak trawls and larval (“20-mm”) gear to sample Delta Smelt across most life stages. Sites are chosen via stratified random sampling. Over the course of a week, field crews sample between 18 and 41 random sites. A minimum of two tows are conducted at each site.  All fish collected are identified (in the field when possible, in the lab for early life stages), measured, enumerated, and recorded. In addition to fish information, environmental data are collected for each sampling event.

          The Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring Program (EDSM) is a branch of the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lodi Office (formerly Stockton Office) and contributes to the monitoring of fish species in the San Francisco Estuary, California as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) for the San Francisco Estuary. EDSM arose from concerns regarding implementation of the 2008 Biological Opinion (BiOp) for Delta Smelt, in particular the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) actions in the BiOp related to reducing the entrainment of adult and juvenile Delta Smelt. EDSM, which began in 2016, samples year-round using Kodiak trawls and larval gears to collect data on nearly all life stages of endangered Delta Smelt. The EDSM sampling year is divided into three phases of implementation that correspond with Delta Smelt life stages and management goals. The primary objective of all phases of EDSM is to provide abundance and distribution data for the corresponding life stages of Delta Smelt. Phase 1 of EDSM runs from December through March and focuses on adult Delta Smelt. Phase 2 sampling takes place from April through June and targets post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt. Phase 3 runs from July through November and targets juvenile and sub-adult Delta Smelt. In general, the EDSM study area is defined as the waters of the San Francisco Estuary occupied by Delta Smelt. The study area is divided into spatially defined, temporally dynamic strata. During 2016-2017 Phase 1 and 2 there were four spatial strata, two falling into a perceived High Risk Zone (high risk of entrainment) and two falling into a Low Risk Zone (low risk of entrainment). As the program evolved, strata were modified to better reflect geographic boundaries and historical Delta Smelt distribution. Within each stratum, sampling locations are selected each week using a generalized random-tessellation stratified (GRTS) design (Stevens and Olsen 2004). The GRTS sampling procedure yields random samples that are spatially well-distributed across a stratum. Field crews sample three to five days per week to sample between 18 and 41 total sites per week (2-15 sites per stratum). Sampling at a chosen location consists of a minimum of two tows to allow estimation of between tow variability. The cumulative level and distribution of effort is adaptively managed, and has the ability to shift between phases and years depending on hydrology, fish population status, and management need.
          (1.) Data collection methods: 
          KODIAK TRAWLS: Kodiak trawls (KDTR) are performed from July through March to target juvenile, sub-adult, and adult Delta Smelt throughout the sampling area. Between 2 and 10 tows are completed at each site, and tow duration has ranged from 2 to 10 minutes. In the case where the first two tows fail to catch Delta Smelt, tows are repeated until at least one Delta Smelt is caught or the limit on total tows is reached. This stopping rule approach simultaneously controls take and allows for greater precision in the estimation of Delta Smelt population parameters. The KDTR consists of two boats, a net boat and a chase boat, each attached with rope leading to a single net that is spread open between the two vessels. The net is towed in the top few meters of the water column at a speed necessary and distance apart to ensure that the net mouth remains fully extended and submerged. The net is towed against the current at speeds between 0.45-0.67 m/s. A calibrated flow meter is fixed the sampling vessel to calculate distance traveled during each tow. For KDTR sample retrieval, the two towing vessels maneuver alongside each other and the chase boat transfers its tow rope to the net boat to close the mouth of the net and end the tow. The chase boat then travels downstream to the live box connected to the cod-end of the net and retrieves, secures, and pulls the live box from the water onto their boat. All fishes collected from the cod end or live box are placed in a holding container filled with water for processing (see Fish Handling section). Lastly, the crew determines the condition of each tow as either normal (defined as no twists, snags, or tears in the net, little to no [less than 5%] debris in/on the net, and no [less than 5%] blockage between the mouth of the net and the live box), fair (defined as partial twists, snags, or small tears in the net, some [5-25% coverage] debris in/on the net, or partial [5-25%] blockage between the mouth of the net to the live box), or poor (defined as complete twists, snags, or large tears in the net, heavy [more than 25% coverage] debris in/on the net, or near complete [more than 25%] blockage between the mouth of the net to the live box).
          LARVAL TRAWLING: Sampling of post-larvae and small juvenile Delta Smelt occurs from April through June using nets with a 1600 micrometer mesh surface, referred to as 20-mm nets. Two tows are completed at each site, and tow duration has ranged from 2.5 to 10 minutes. Most larval trawling performed by EDSM involves large 20-mm nets that have a D-shaped opening, are attached to a weighted sled, and are towed by a single boat. The sled is attached to a hydraulic winch and is towed behind the boat following an oblique tow path from the deepest portion of the sample site (up to 10 m) to the surface of the water. Calibrated flow meters are fixed to both the net opening and the sampling vessel to calculate distance traveled during each tow. At the end of each tow, the sled is pulled in and the net is washed down towards the cod-end using filtered water. Sample contents are preserved in the field and returned to the laboratory for processing (see Fish Handling section below).  
During 2017 Phase 2, each week up to six regular 20-mm sites (sampled with the large 20-mm nets) were paired with shallow water sampling. Within 100 m of a regular site, a small 20-mm larval net was used to sample in shallow water (less than 2.4 m) concurrently with the regular deep water sample. The small 20-mm net was approximately one-third the size of the large net, and was deployed from the side of the boat without a sled. The minimum depth was considered the minimum point that the boat could safely operate, which depended on the bathymetry and slope of the sample area. Occasionally, samples were paired with additional near-shore samples collected using a small 20-mm net. The small 20-mm net was pulled through the top 0.84 m of the surface of the water.
          FISH HANDLING: Generally, all fish in each sample that are greater than or equal to 25 mm fork length (FL) are identified to species or race, with the exception of five species that are readily identified at greater than or equal to 20 mm FL: Sacramento Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), Three-spine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), Rainwater Killifish (Lucania parva), and Sacramento Sucker (Catostomus occidentalis). Prior to release at the site of capture, we measure fish to the nearest 1 mm FL. If greater than 50 individuals of a Chinook Salmon race, as designated by the river length-at-capture-date criteria (LDC, see paragraph below), or other species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are captured, a subsample of 50 individuals are randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured (referred to as a plus count). If greater than 30 individuals of a non-listed species are captured, a subsample of 30 individuals is randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured. Fish that cannot be accurately identified in the field are brought back to the laboratory. Identification is then confirmed with the use of dichotomous keys and/or with the aid of a microscope. During larval sampling, fish that cannot be identified in the field (generally most fish sampled using larval gear types) are preserved in a solution of 10% buffered formalin and Rose Bengal and brought back to the lab. These samples undergo several levels of laboratory processing, beginning with sorting, followed by several stages of larval fish identification using keys and other published materials. Fish that are still unable to be confidently identified are sent out for additional outside verification. Most Delta Smelt caught between July and November of each year receive genetic ID confirmation via mitochondrial DNA and/or nuclear DNA testing. 
The race of all unmarked juvenile Chinook Salmon (i.e., no adipose fin clip to indicate that it is a hatchery fish) are determined using the river LDC developed by Fisher (1992) and modified by Greene (1992). The assumptions associated with the river LDC for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin are that (1) spawning of fall-run Chinook Salmon occurs between October 1-December 31, (2) spawning of late fall-run Chinook Salmon occurs between January 1-April 15, (3) spawning of winter-run Chinook Salmon occurs between April 16-August 15, (4) spawning of spring-run Chinook Salmon occurs between August 16-September 30, and that (5) the growth rates of fish are identical among all Chinook Salmon races (Fisher 1992). Although one or more of these assumptions are likely violated (Fisher 1994; Yoshiyama et al. 1998), the river LDC is currently widely used by managers, and is the only cost effective and logistically feasible way to differentiate between the different races of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the field. Fisher (1994) noted that Chinook Salmon races within the Central Valley do appear to spawn at distinctly separate time periods except for fall- and spring-run due to the loss of headwater habitats (e.g., resulting from dams), forced coexistence, and subsequent hybridization within the Sacramento River basin (Banks et al. 2000; Greig et al. 2003; Banks et al. 2014). As a result, many of the Chinook Salmon characterized as spring-run by the river LDC may actually be fall-run. We use the river LDC to differentiate between unmarked winter-run sized, spring-run sized, fall-run sized, and late fall-run sized juvenile Chinook Salmon. The race designations used in this dataset should be considered a rough approximation and not interpreted as definitive. 
Juvenile Chinook Salmon with missing (clipped) adipose fins are considered marked fish. All clipped juvenile Chinook Salmon observed in recent years are considered hatchery-reared and are brought back to the laboratory for coded wire tag retrieval in order to acquire information on hatchery origin and release location. 
          WATER QUALITY: Water quality measurements are taken before each sampling tow from the top 1 m of the water column. Temperature is recorded to the nearest 0.1 C, dissolved oxygen to the nearest 0.01 mg/L, and specific conductance to the nearest 0.01 microsiemen/centimeter for freshwater or millisiemen/centimeter for salt water. A turbidity meter is used to measure turbidity to the nearest 0.01 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). A Secchi disk is also used to measure water clarity; Secchi disk measurements are always taken in the shade with sunglasses off. During larval sampling, water quality is also taken from the bottom of the water column using Van Dorn style samplers before each tow. The sampler is deployed slowly down to the bottom, then 1-2 feet of line is pulled in for the water sample to be taken.
          (2.) Sampling effort, fish catch, and water quality data are recorded using datasheets based on a modified version of the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program datasheet (available upon request to the data contact).
          (3.) Instruments and equipment: 
          KODIAK TRAWL: The KDTR nets used are identical to those used by the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program and are composed of five panels, each decreasing in mesh size towards a live box at the cod end. The mesh size for each panel ranges from 5.1 cm stretch at the mouth to 0.3 cm stretch just before the live box. The live box (36 cm wide x 36 cm tall x 49 cm long) is composed of 0.18 cm thick aluminum that is perforated with numerous 0.46 cm diameter holes. The live box contains several internal baffles intended to minimize fish mortality and stress due to flow pressure. The fully extended mouth size of the KDTR net is 1.83 x 7.62 m. A float line and lead line enable the net to remain at the top few meters of the water column while sampling. In addition, at the front of each wing of the net is a 1.83 m spreader bar with floats at the top and weights at the bottom to keep depth constant while sampling. The KDTR net is connected to the boats using a 2.3 m rope bridle (2.4 cm diameter) attached to a 30.5 m tow rope (0.95 cm diameter) on each side of the net. The net is fished approximately 31 m from the boats. The measure of the distance traveled during each tow is recorded using a calibrated mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics, Model 2030) deployed alongside the boat. Volume sampled by each KDTR is estimated by calculating the difference between the end and starting value of the flow meter, and multiplying it by the factory-stated K calibration factor (0.026873) and the trawl net mouth area. The mean net mouth area for KDTR nets was estimated to be 12.54 m2 based on the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Programs 1995 annual report (USFWS 1998).
          LARVAL SMELT SAMPLING: The large 20-mm net consists of 1600 micrometer square mesh and is identical to that used by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife 20-mm Survey. The large net is 5.5 m long, with a mouth circumference of 4.9 m and mouth area of 1.51 m2. The small 20-mm net was composed of 1600 micrometer square mesh with dimensions approximately one-third those of the large 20-mm net. The cod end jars used for both 20-mm nets were 2 L Nalgene polyethylene bottles screwed into a General Oceanics ring and attached to the canvas collar at the cod end of the net by a hose clamp. Calibrated flow meters (General Oceanics, Model 2030) are fixed to both the net opening and the sampling vessel to calculate distance traveled during each tow. Volume sampled by each tow is estimated by calculating the difference between the end and starting value of the net flow meter, and multiplying it by the factory-stated K calibration factor (0.026873) and the 20-mm net mouth area. 
          WATER QUALITY: Water quality measurements such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity are conducted using the YSI PRO 2030 Meter. Turbidity is collected using Hach 2100Q turbidity meters. Secchi disks are also used to measure water clarity. During 20-mm larval sled sampling, a LaMotte Horizontal Water Sampler model 1077 or 1087 is used to retrieve water from the bottom of the water column for water quality. 
The dissolved oxygen probe on the YSI PRO 2030 is quick-calibrated before each day of sampling and if a calibration fails, the instrument is no longer used until the necessary repairs have been made. The YSI probe is serviced monthly and dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature are calibrated. The Hach 2100Q Turbidity Meter calibration is checked monthly and calibrated every three months. Flow meters are cleaned and checked for calibration weekly. If flowmeters do not spin within specifications, they are swapped out.
          (4.) Analysis and methods: Data is in its original form and no catch per effort calculations have been made. Standard operating procedures for sampling methods and quality checks are available upon request. 
          (5.) Project history (change in methods and locations): Modifications to all fish sampling (Kodiak trawls and 20-mm larval sampling) are made regularly to improve data accuracy, respond to management needs, adhere to permit limitations, and accommodate safety conditions and/or special studies. If you would like more information on EDSM program changes over time, please reach out to the data contact. 
          2016: EDSM test sampling began in November 2016 and official sampling began on December 15, 2016. Initially, only areas of the study area considered to contain a high density of Delta Smelt were sampled (from December 15, 2016 through January 8, 2017). In January 2017, areas of lower Delta Smelt density were added to the sampling frame when additional EDSM field crews were assembled. By January 31, 2017, the full sampling frame of EDSM was covered by sampling crews. 
          2016-2019: The spatial stratification of EDSM sampling has been dynamic, adapting as the program has evolved. For each phase of EDSM sampling, the sampling frame and stratification system is determined by considering current Delta Smelt population patterns, environmental conditions, and management objectives. Maximum number of tows performed per site and tow duration has also been somewhat dynamic. Questions regarding details of stratification, tow max, or tow duration during different phases of EDSM can be addressed to the data contact. 
          2017: From approximately February 25 through March 2017, closures on the San Joaquin River (due to levy stability) restricted some sampling in the High Risk Low Density strata. 
          2017: Beginning on May 5, 2017, all sampling crews were directed to identify and enumerate all crustaceans and jellyfish collected during EDSM sampling. This had not been specified before this date, so crustacean and jellyfish numbers from earlier dates are likely underestimated. 
          2017: From June 26-28 and July 24-26, 2017, gear comparisons between Kodiak trawling, 20-mm oblique towing, and 20-mm surface water towing were conducted. 
          2017: After July 1, 2017 the station code (unique station identifier for each randomly-generated sampling site) began to include sample year and sample week (YY-Sample week-Subregion).
          2017-2018: Since summer 2017, EDSM has collaborated on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Effect of Outflow Alteration upon Delta Smelt Habitat, Condition and Survival study (or Directed Outflow Project, DOP), which aims to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses related to the rationale behind summer and fall outflow actions. This includes flash freezing the Delta Smelt collected in the DOP study regions for the evaluation of health and condition, diet, and otolith processing to reconstruct growth, salinity, and thermal history.
          2018: EDSM spent April and May 2018 preparing for and conducting experimental larval sampling to investigate alternative larval sampling methods performed in different depth strata. EDSM completed pilot sampling with an experimental beach seine and Manta nets in April 2018 and three official experimental sampling days in May. Regular 20-mm sampling resumed as scheduled in June 2018 to allow estimation of post-larval abundances and associated standard errors. Only 20-mm sampling data from June 2018 is shared at this time. 
          2019: EDSM spent April and May 2019 conducting additional experimental larval sampling to investigate alternative larval sampling methods performed in different depth strata. EDSM used the same gears developed and tested in 2018, as well as the additional method of light trapping. Regular 20-mm sampling resumed as scheduled in June 2019 to allow estimation of post-larval abundances and associated standard errors. Only 20-mm sampling data from June 2019 is shared at this time. 
          
2019: Specific conductance is used instead of un-specified conductivity measurement. Unclear whether conductivity measurements in prior years were adjusted for temperature.
          (6.) QA/QC: A Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program exists to ensure consistent data generation by following the EDSM standard operating procedures. The program ensures accurate identification of fish species in the field and accurate collection of environmental data. For early life stage fish identification, two or more experienced identifiers examine every fish until consensus is reached on species. Double entry of datasheets is used to check the accuracy of all data entry. Additional proofing (e.g., outlier searches) occurs weekly and as needed ahead of reports and data sharing.
          METHODS: The program has a dedicated fish biologist that is responsible for training field personnel in fish identification and implementing a field QA/QC program. The QA/QC program consists of testing the fish ID skills of the field crew using preserved and wild specimens at least twice a year, reviewing preserved fish samples that are brought back from the field, and accompanying field personnel when sampling to assure correct identification of the fish species. All unknown fish species found in the field are brought back to the laboratory to ensure correct identification. All personnel are trained following standard operating procedures (SOP) for field sampling, data entry and QA/QC, and lab processing during their first weeks of employment and then work with experienced employees for the first 3 months of their employment.  
          DATA: Kodiak trawl data are entered into an online entry form linked to a SQL server housed at US Fish and Wildlife Service offices in Denver, CO. Kodiak trawl data are then accessed and retrieved through a Microsoft Access application. 20-mm data are entered into and stored in a locally housed Microsoft Access database. Both Kodiak trawl and 20-mm are entered a second time into Microsoft Access forms with customized error-checking and data validation checks. Prior to October 2017, data QA/QC was done by having a crew member compare the original field data sheet with the entered data line-by-line to ensure that the values in the field datasheet and the database matched. The program initiated the new data QA/QC protocol in October 2017 in which data is entered twice into two separate databases and then followed by a custom query that attempts to match the two datasets. When a mismatch is found, the field data sheet is reviewed and errors are corrected in the main and/or the duplicate database. Additional data quality checks are performed by the data manager using custom queries and ArcGIS (to check coordinates), and R to check for outliers. Outlier values are flagged with a comment when they are identified. While data have undergone an established QA/QC process, we still suggest assessing data for outliers based on your intended use of the data.
          (7.) Contractor information: All fish identification and water quality measures are conducted by the field staff of the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program, Lodi Fish and Wildlife Office, United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
          (8.) External review process: EDSM has undergone a number of collegial reviews. These include yearly reviews by the Interagency Ecological Program. In 2017, EDSM was also included as part of the 2017 Long-term Operations Biological Opinions (LOBO) Biennial Science Review. The final report of findings was published in January 2018.
